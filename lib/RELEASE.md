# 1.1

This release adds some Quality of Life updates to Schmidt Scoreboard

- Styles "If there was an error..." buttons on setup screens to be more clickable
- Favorite teams for each league appear on the home screen so that behavior is more predictable
- Button to add favorite teams is now the entire list item
- Hamburger button to see multiple scoreboards appears on Onboarding screens as well as home screen. Added a description to the My Scoreboards screen
- Confirmation dialog for adding WiFi credentials. It is very important that WiFi credentials are accurate during setup--incorrect credentials require redoing the entire setup process. This should give users a chance to double check their submission and try again if they made a mistake.
- Updating Connection screen to make it more obvious when the App is connected to a scoreboard's local wifi connection
